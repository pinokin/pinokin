# Hello, I'm Tuija
`Accessibility oriented UX designer and web developer passionate about CSS.`

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a client website where I'm using Wordpress as a headless CMS, and the frontend is done with Astro.
- 💬 Ask me about accessibility and CSS. And typography. And PKM (Personal Knowledge Management). And stickers. Oh, and cats! Ask me about cats. 😻
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've studied over 20 languages during the years, some to a higher level than others. Currently I'm learning Danish and Korean.
