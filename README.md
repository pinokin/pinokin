# Hello, I'm Tuija
`A UX designer and a web developer passionate about a11y and CSS.`

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a client website where I'm using Wordpress as a headless CMS, and the frontend is done with Astro.
- 💬 Ask me about accessibility and CSS. And typography. And PKM (Personal Knowledge Management). And stickers. Oh, and cats! Ask me about my cats. 😻
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've studied over 20 languages during the years, some to a higher level than others. Currently I'm learning Danish and Korean.
